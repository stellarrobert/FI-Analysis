# FI-Analysis
This post explores the 2016 survey data for users of the r/financialindependence subreddit. This community is skewed toward those who are ultra-passionate about personal finance, interested in aggressive saving and investing. Here, 1,377 community members released their answers to survey questions ranging from their career to living situation to even their upbringing. This analysis addresses three main questions:

1)	How do financial goals change as users get older?
2)	How does upbringing affect usersâ€™ financial wellbeing in adulthood?
3)	How does a given person compare to this group of users?
